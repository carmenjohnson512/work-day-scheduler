## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## App Functionality


This is a daily planner that displays the current date and time at the top of the calendar. <br>
Below the date and time are (8) timeblocks for the standard business hours of 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. <br>
When you view the timeblocks for the current day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. <br>
When you click into a timeblock, you can enter an event or "to do" item, and click the "save" button for that timeblock to save the event to local storage. <br>
When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist. To delete an entry, simply clear the input field and press "save" again.
